# Reviewerlizer

Oh man, review season can be _tough_. Having to think of things to say about your colleagues and then _write them down_, UGH.

## Usage

Open an issue on this repo for each person you owe a peer review to. The reviewerlizer will generate useful, actionable feedback for you dear colleague and post it to the issue. Congratulations, you've finished your reviews in record quick time, I recommend taking the rest of the day off üçπ.
